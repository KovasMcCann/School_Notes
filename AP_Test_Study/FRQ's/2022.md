3 Level's 

 - Defined by classes


Methods for each level

goalReached()
- returns true if the level is passed "goal reached"

getPoints()
- Returns the number of points recorded for this level?

Write two methods for the Game class

getScore()

isBonus() checks if this is a bonus game

goalReached() if the goal has been reached

getPoints()

Rules for scoring:
- Level one points are earned only if the level one goal is reached.  Level two points are earned only if both the level one and level two goals are reached.  Level three points are earned only if the goals of all three levels are reached. 

- The score for the game is the sum of the points earned for levels one, two, and three. 

- If the game is a bonus game, the score for the game is tripled

```java
public int getScore(){

    int one = 0;
    int two = 0;
    int three = 0;
    
    if (levelOne.goalReached()){
        int one = levelOne.getPoints();

        if (levelTwo.getPoints()){
            int two = levelTwo.getPoints();

            if (levelThree.getPoints()){
                int three = levelThree.getPoints();
            }
        }
    }

    if (isBonus())
        return 3 * (one + two + three);
    
    return one + two + three;
}
```

```java
