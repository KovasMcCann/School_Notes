## Problem 1

### Notes

3 Level's 

 - Defined by classes


Methods for each level

goalReached()
- returns true if the level is passed "goal reached"

getPoints()
- Returns the number of points recorded for this level?

Write two methods for the Game class

getScore()

isBonus() checks if this is a bonus game

goalReached() if the goal has been reached

getPoints()

Rules for scoring:
- Level one points are earned only if the level one goal is reached.  Level two points are earned only if both the level one and level two goals are reached.  Level three points are earned only if the goals of all three levels are reached. 

- The score for the game is the sum of the points earned for levels one, two, and three. 

- If the game is a bonus game, the score for the game is tripled

### A

```java
public int getScore(){

    int one = 0;
    int two = 0;
    int three = 0;
    
    if (levelOne.goalReached()){
        int one = levelOne.getPoints();

        if (levelTwo.getPoints()){
            int two = levelTwo.getPoints();

            if (levelThree.getPoints()){
                int three = levelThree.getPoints();
            }
        }
    }

    if (isBonus())
        return 3 * (one + two + three);
    
    return one + two + three;
}
```

### B

playManyTimes(int numberoftimes)

```java
public int playManyTimes(int num){
    int highest = 0;

    for (int x = 0; x < num; x++){
        play(); //my old solution was wrong learn more about this
        if (iteration.getPoints() > highest){
            highest == iteration.getPoints();
        }
    }

    return hightest;
}
```

## Problem 2 

### Notes

The `Book` class is used to store information about a book

variables
title
price

Methods

book(bookTitle, bookPrice)

getTitle()

getBookInfo()

return title + "-" + price;

Create a class Textbook subclass Book

has edition number

getBookInfo also returns edition information

```java
public class Textbook extends Book{

    private String edition;

    public Textbook(String bookTitle, double bookPrice, int bookEdition) {
        super(bookTitle, bookPrice); //this will run book(bookTitle, bookPrice)
        private String edition = bookEdition;
    }

    //Forgot to add getEdition()
    public int getEdition(){
        return edition;
    }

    // Need to add more title
    public boolean canSubstituteFor(Textbook check){
        if (check.getTitle().equals(getTitle())){
            if (check.getEdition() >= edition){
                return true;
            }
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
    }

    public String getBookInfo(){
        return title + "-" + price + "-" + edition;
    }
}
```


## Problem 3 (DID NOT COMPLETE)

ReviewAnalysis contains methods used to analyze the reviews and provided by users.

```java
public double getAverageRating(){ 
    int sum = 0; 
    for (Review r : allReviews){ 
        sum += r.getRating();
    } 
    return (double) sum / allReviews.length;
} 
```

```java
public ArrayList<String> collectComments(){ 
    ArrayList<String> commentList = new ArrayList<String>(); 
    for (int i = 0; i < allReviews.length; i++){ 
        String comment = allReviews[i].getComment();
        if (comment.indexOf("!") >= 0){ 
        String last = comment.substring(comment.length() â€“ 1);
        if (!last.equals("!") && !last.equals(".")){ 
            comment += ".";
        }
        commentList.add(i + "-" + comment);
        }
    }
    return commentList;
} 
```

## Problem 4

```java
public void repopulate(){ 
    for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; row++){ 
        for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++){ 
            int rval = (int)(Math.random() * MAX) + 1;
            while (rval % 10 != 0 || rval % 100 == 0){ 
                rval = (int)(Math.random() * MAX) + 1;
            }
            grid[row][col] = rval;
        }
    }
} 
``` 
 
```java 
public int countIncreasingCols(){ 
    int count = 0; 
    for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++){ 
        boolean ordered = true; 
        for (int row = 1; row < grid.length; row++){ 
            if (grid[row][col] < grid[row-1][col]){ 
                ordered = false;
            }
        } 
        if (ordered){ 
            count++;
        }   
    } 
    return count; 
}
```
