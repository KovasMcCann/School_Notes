Unit 5:

Two types of market sturctures:

Perfect Comp. 
 Many small firms are hiring workers
 Many workers with identical skills
 wage is constant
 workers are **Wage Takers**

Monopsony
 one frim hiring workers
 workers are relativiely immobile
 firm is wage maker


Demand for labor

how much workers will a firm hire

What is the law of demand for labor?
There is an INVERSE relationship between wage and quanity of labor demanded

Supply of labor

the different amount of workers that are willing and able to work

Law of supply 

there is a direct relationship between wage and quanity of labor supplied

FIRMS DEMAND LABOR
\v

INDIVIDUALS SUPPLY LABOR
/^

3 Shifters of Demand

 Changes in the Demand for the product (not the worker but the thing there makeing)

 Changes in productivity of the resource (want to hire better workers)

 Changes in price of other resources (if there is a better alternative or substatue)

3 Shifter of supply

 Number of qualified workers 

 Government regulation (Trainging and Licensing)
 
 Personal values regargding leisure time and societal roles.

Minium wage

 Minium amount of pay
 
 Creates a surplus of workers (unemployment)
 
 Q demand falls

 Q supplied increases

MRC 

The addition cost of hiring one more worker

in perfect comp. mrc equals wage

       Change in total cost
MRC =  --------------------
       Change in inputs

MRC = Wage rate
or
delta of previous worker plus current

MRP

The additional revenue of hiring another worker

      Change in total revenue
MRP = ---------------------
      Change in total inputs 

MP * Product Price = MRP

MP

The change in output from one worker to another

How many workers should you hire?

where MRP = MRC 

Labor Market Imperfections

 Insufficent job information
 
 Geographical immobility
  Can't move to higher pay
 
 Unions
 
 Wage Discrimination

Combinging resources

Least Cost:
MP/P to compare resources

Maximize profit:
MRPx    MRPy
---- = ------ = 1
MRCx    MRCy
