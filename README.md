## Course Description

In this course, we use the definition:  
*"Computer science is the study of how we use computers to solve human problems."*  

This definition focuses on the problem-solving aspect of computer science. One major theme of AP Computer Science A, and really CS in general, is problem-solving. It’s about developing solutions that can scale up from simple to complex problems. On the AP CS A exam, you will be using the programming language **Java** to solve problems, design strategies, debug, and analyze potential solutions.

### Course Units

#### Semester 1:
1. Primitive Types  
2. Using Objects  
3. Boolean Expressions and If Statements  
4. Iteration  
5. Writing Classes  

#### Semester 2:
6. Arrays  
7. ArrayLists  
8. 2D Arrays  
9. Inheritance  
10. Recursion  
11. AP Exam Sharpening (Review)

## Dual Credit Through College of Dupage

Our AP Computer Science Program partners with the College of Dupage to provide students with a Dual Credit opportunity. The year-long APCS course aligns with two semester-long courses at COD: **CIS 1400** (Programming Logic & Technique) and **CIS 2571** (Introduction to Java Programming). 

COD will send enrollment information towards the end of the first semester. Enrolling in dual credit is optional. If you choose to enroll, your 1st semester APCS grade will transfer to **CIS 1400** (Programming and Logic), and your 2nd semester APCS grade will transfer to **CIS 2571** (Introduction to Java).

For more details, check the COD course syllabi for [CIS 1400](#) and [CIS 2571](#).

## Grading Methods & Procedures

Grades are posted in the District 99 Home Access Center. Tutorials can be found on the district website ([here](#)).  

Semester grades are generally not rounded. However, if a student completes all major assignments, seeks extra help, and takes advantage of retake opportunities, the teacher may round grades at their discretion.  

### Academic Integrity  
All students are expected to maintain academic integrity at all times. Any student demonstrating academic dishonesty is subject to both academic and disciplinary consequences outlined in the Student/Parent Handbook.

---

### Due Dates  
- **Assessments for Learning** (Review Questions, Coding Activities, etc.) are due before the first class period of the following week.
- **Assessments of Learning** (Quizzes, Exams, End-of-Unit Assignments) are due on the posted due date in Google Classroom unless there are extenuating circumstances.  
Late work and retake policies apply.

---

### Late Work Policy
- **Assessments for Learning** can be submitted up until the end of the unit in which they were assigned. After the unit exam, all "Z4" grades are final.
- **Summative Assessments** will be handled on a case-by-case basis depending on circumstances.

### Retake Policy
- **Assessments for Learning** can be resubmitted as many times as necessary before the due date.
- **Quizzes and Exams** will have **one retake each**.

---

### Grading Scale
- 100-90 = A
- 89-80 = B
- 79-70 = C
- 69-60 = D
- 59-0 = F

### Weighted Assignments and Percentages
- **Review Questions and Code Activities** (Assessments for Learning in HAC): 10%
- **Quizzes and End of Unit Assignments** (Quizzes and Labs in HAC): 30%
- **Exams** (Exams in HAC): 60%

---

### HAC Gradebook Legend
- **Z4**: Assignment/assessment not attempted or completed.
- **L4**: Assignment attempted but scored below 40%.

---

## Classroom Expectations
- Follow the D99 Student/Parent Handbook regarding General Building Conduct and use of Personal Electronic Devices.
- Behave respectfully to everyone in the classroom.
- Work to create a safe environment to explore difficult concepts.
- Come prepared and accept challenges in coursework.
- Be willing to seek help when needed.

---

## Personal Electronic Device Policy

To reduce distractions and increase engagement, personal electronic devices (cell phones, earbuds, smart watches, etc.) must be silenced and not used during instructional settings unless permission is given by the teacher.

If violations occur within a reasonable timeframe:
1. Additional verbal warnings.
2. Family contact regarding continued behavior.
3. Behavior referral to deans for disciplinary actions.

### Classroom Specific Policy
In Mr. Buhot’s classroom, cell phones and earbuds must be silenced and stored in backpacks before class begins. The policy for phone use will be indicated on a sign (Red = no phones; Green = permission granted). If students misuse this privilege, they will be asked to put their phone away.
