# Unit 4

## Question 1

What is output to the screen by the following code?

```java
int f = 0
while (f < 7){
  System.out.print(f % 3 + " ")
  f++;
}
```

> 0 1 2 0 1 2 0

### Explanation

The reason for this is becuase the while loop starts at 0 and goes until 6 **(x < 7 would go to 6)** standard output returns the mode of `f` by `3`
