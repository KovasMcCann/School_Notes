# Unit 8 Test Practice

## Question 1

Consider the following method: 

```java
public static int mystery(int[] nums){
  int total = 0;
  for (int k = 0; k < nums.length / 2; k++){
    total = total + nums[k];
  }
}
```

Assume that the array test has been declared and initilized as follows

```java
int[] test = {3, 1, 9. 4. 7, 0, 2, 6};
```

## Answer

    grid[i][j] = c;
    c++;
  }
}

```
