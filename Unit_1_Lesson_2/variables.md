# Casting

Casting is when you need to convert variables(Data types)

There are two ways to cast

* Widening (``byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double``) 

* Narrowing (``double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte``)

Example:
``` 
double myDouble = myInt 
```

## Narrowing
Define narrowing
