# variables:
there are different types of variables in java

## examples
    String: Stores Text defined by double quotes

    int: Stores Whole numbers

    float: Stores Floating point numbers i.e. 10.343

    char: Stores a single character i.e. 'f'
    
    boolean: True/False


## printing variables

To print a variable in java you can use the ``+`` character

# Casting

Casting is when you need to convert variables(Data types)

There are two ways to cast

* Widening (``byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double``) 

* Narrowing (``double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte``)

## Widening
Widening is done automaticly and can be done with a ``=``
Example:
``` 
double myDouble = myInt 
```

## Narrowing
