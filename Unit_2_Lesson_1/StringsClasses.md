# Strings and Classes

## Primitive and Class Data Types

There are two data types in java Primitive and Class Types

### Primitive

Primitive data types only hold one piece of data at a time.

When you create(Declare) a Primitive Data Type Java creates a space in memory and stores the data there. This is the same location were the variable name is stored.

### Class

When you create a Class Data Type Java allocates a space in memory called a **reference** a reference only shows were that data is stored. This could help with large data types

### NULL

If you want a data type to be blank you can use NULL to set a class to blank.

```java
String a = null;
```
